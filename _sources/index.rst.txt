The Velocity Obstacle algorithm - Collision avoidance for ASVs in compliance with COLREGs
=========================================================================================
This is a documentation for a collision avoidance algorithm for autonomous surface vehicle in compliance with the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea 1972 (COLREGs).
It includes a brief introduction to the motivation of the work, the basics and a description of the algorithm used.
It also includes instructions on how to install and use the algorithm, as well as the possibility to test the algorithm in the `MARUSimulator <https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9976969>`_.
In the conclusion is also the implementation of the algorithm in python with detailed description of each function.
