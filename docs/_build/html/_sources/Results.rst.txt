This section presents some results of the VO algorithm tested in the MARUSimulator. Several different encounters with different amount of TS has been tested. In the simulation
all TSs do not take any action even if they are supposed to. The speed of the TSs is constant and the OS can only detect TSs that are at a distance of 50 m or closer.
