This section presents some results of the VO algorithm tested in the MARUSimulator. Several different encounters with different amount of TS has been tested. In the simulation
all TSs do not take any action even if they are supposed to. The speed of the TSs is constant and the OS can only detect TSs that are at a distance of 50 m or closer.

Head-on
-------
For the head-on scenario four situations are presented here which shows the effect of different speeds of the TS on the avoidance maneuver as well as different detection ranges of the OS.

Right-crossing
--------------
For the right-crossing scenario three situation are displayed here in which each TS is coming from a different direction towards the OS. 

Left-crossing
-------------
For the left-crossing scenario three situation are displayed here in which each TS is coming from a different direction towards the OS.
